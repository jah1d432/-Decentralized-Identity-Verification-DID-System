## 📌 Project Title

**Decentralized Identity Verification (DID) System on Core DAO**

---

## 📖 Project Description

A blockchain-based decentralized identity system built to securely verify user identities while preserving their privacy using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). This system enables users to submit identity commitments off-chain and have their identity verified on-chain by authorized verifiers — all without revealing sensitive personal data.

Built on the Core DAO blockchain, the system leverages the network's fast and secure layer-1 infrastructure for maximum scalability and decentralization.

## 🎯 Project Vision

To create a permissionless, privacy-preserving identity verification framework for decentralized applications, DAOs, and DeFi platforms. By allowing off-chain proof generation and on-chain verification, the system aims to:

- Empower users to control their identity
- Ensure privacy through cryptographic commitments
- Promote trustless, decentralized onboarding

---

## 🚀 Future Scope

- ✅ Integration with ZK proof libraries like Semaphore or Zokrates
- ✅ Interoperable identity bridging across EVM-compatible chains
- ✅ DAO governance module to allow community-elected verifiers
- ✅ Verifier reputation system based on performance
- ✅ IPFS/Arweave for decentralized storage of encrypted identity metadata

## 🔑 Key Features

- 🧾 **Decentralized Verification**: Verifiers can verify user identity without accessing sensitive data.
- 🧠 **Zero-Knowledge Support**: Store only ZK proof hashes or commitments, not actual identity data.
- 🔐 **Privacy First**: Identity proofs are submitted as hash commitments — secure and private.
- 🛡️ **Role-Based Access**: Admin adds/removes verifiers; only verifiers can validate identities.
- 🔎 **Public Verifiability**: Any contract or user can check whether an identity has been verified.
- ⚡ **Core DAO Compatible**: Fully EVM-compatible and optimized for Core DAO Testnet/Mainnet.
